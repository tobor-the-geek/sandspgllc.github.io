</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in">Jan</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in">As you all know Roy was an engineer all
the way down to his bones.  It is the facts, please just the facts.
Oh, but if you can drop some obscure humorous tie, all the better! 
So let’s get the facts out first.  Roy was born at the end of the
Boomer period, and while he did represent many of the stereotypical
aspects of that generation, he was not comfortable with the label.
Heck he was not not comfortable with many labels or instructions for
that matter.  He was the first son, eldest of six siblings.  While we
had three children of our own, we had provided many, some form of 
partial parenting of our children's friends.  
</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in"><br/>

</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in">As for us, we met while in college and
I can’t say either of us were hit by love at first sight.  He did
ask me out and somehow I guess we grew on each other as we continued
to date.  We took an undefined break after college. Some time passed
but we connected again and became a couple. We married on Valentines
day, and began our married life.  He was definitely the ying to my
yang, and undoubtedly were each other's best friend.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in"><br/>

</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in">Through the years, the one thing I
knew, could be absolutely assured of, was that he loved me and would
do anything for me.  He was always trying, and actually did help and
make things better more often than not. Now that didn’t mean that
he wouldn’t do the most stupid thing possible.  For a smart man, he
would make some pretty big mistakes.  None out of malice, or had the
intention of creating the resulting pain.  He would always apologize
and explain that he was trying to help, or trying to make things
better. 
</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in"><br/>

</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in">Roy was a good father, always there,
and supported our children.  Our house was often filled with their
friends, and he was sure to include them as family. He was
extravagantly generous.  He tried to do this anonymously, through
organizations and others.  He always said it was nobody’s business
what he gave.  It was not infrequent for him to pay it forward in the
drive-through, give an extravagant tip, or ask for anonymity when he
sponsored something through an organization.  While some may try to
find a few singles to give the panhandler, Roy, if moved, would toss
in a $20.  Roy would often say he did not like people, that was not
true; he cared for people, always willing to help, and strived for
fairness.  
</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in"><br/>

</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in">One of the best attributes Roy had was
humor, at least in his own mind.  He would laugh, out loud, at his
own jokes. We had to be careful when watching funny movies, he would
laugh so hard he would nearly pass out.  Oh, and could he ever spin a
yarn.  If he could keep himself from breaking up, you had a hard time
discerning fact from fiction.  He was so convincing and you knew of
his plethora of useless facts.  He was seldon a bad choice for a
trivia team, unless it was arts, or literature.  
</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in"><br/>

</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in">I am certain Roy would most want all of
you here today to not dwell on his absence, but remember something
that makes you smile, then pass it on.  Roy had a lot of love, I will
miss him desperately but I will alway be warmed by remembering how
big that love was, and I got to be part of it.  Then think of some
silly Dad joke he would say, and SMILE!</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in"><br/>

</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in"><br/>

</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in">Children</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in">We were like having 2 separate
families.  The Boys at one end and Bri at the other.  Dad
transitioned over time; but what never changed was the knowledge that
he loved you, and he was proud of you.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in"><br/>

</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in">In the Boys early years, Dad could not
make it to every event, but if possible he would regardless, if it
was his only day off, or only just come home.  Whenever we needed
help he would be there.  Rather it was doing Algebra or Calculus on
the whiteboard in the kitchen, or reading a few chapters, or cramming
for a test, he would do all he could to help.  When a Scout Leader
was needed, Dad became a Scout leader.  When a Soccer Coach was
needed, he was a soccer coach.  When the PTO or Band Boosters needed
help, he joined (with Mom of course). As Dad’s career progressed
and he transitioned to a work from home job his availability changed;
but not his willingness to help us all.  While Bri may have had him
attend more events; he was sure to let us all know we were loved and
how proud he was of all our achievements.  
</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in"><br/>

</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in">As Mom had indicated, he was hilarious,
in his mind.  He would always assess a charge to our friends that
stayed for dinner, spent the night, or even just got a drink.  He
never collected on it, it was just his running joke to all of our
friends.  When Dad gave you a nickname, and assessed a toll for
internet access, you were good in his eyes.  
</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in"><br/>

</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in">We will miss him, we always knew he
loved us, and he would be there.  And oh, Dad; now it is my turn,
it’s costing you $5.00 for my attendance today!</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in"><br/>

</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in"><br/>

</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in">Learning Partner</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in">Roy was almost obsessed with helping. 
He had a strong desire to help others succeed, he would be nearly as
excited as we were on any success, and very consoling if there was a
mis-step of some sort.  He felt that he was learning along with us,
hence why he used the term learning partner.  He gave freely of his
insight, his experience, and his opinions.  He did play the straight
man with us, and we hardly got to see that funny streak. Although if
someone left it out there, he almost felt obliged to set a zinger. 
Now on social events, we did get a good view of that, quote, humor,
end of quote.  
</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in"><br/>

</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in">Roy was easy to talk to, and almost
immediately felt we were friends.  You always knew where you stood,
and he would let you know if there was difference in opinion. He
wouldn’t pressure you to change your mind. He was accepting and
open minded. He very much felt more like a lost brother or crazy
uncle.  You felt included, safe, and understood.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in"><br/>

</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in">What we’ll miss most is that warm
family feeling.  It is almost like losing a family member, but when
we recall what he shared with us I am sure we will feel blessed for
knowing him.</p>
