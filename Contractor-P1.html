<h3>WE&rsquo;LL MAKE YOUR LIFE EASIER</h3>
<div class="center9"><span style="color:black">
We have a proven system in place with a pre-determined Scope Of Work containing all the details of the renovations in one spot, making life much easier for our contractors. We select all the materials that will go into our homes, and we clearly lay out everything that we want done by our contractors, so that they can focus on doing the work they do best—contracting. Working within our system will allow you to move from job to job to job, and not have to worry about where your next job is coming from. We always hear from our contractors that one of the best things about working with <b>S and S Property Group</b> is how every component in the Scope of Work is a line item with description details, and materials often even have the associated SKU# and where to purchase it included. We know time is money for both of us, so we do the extra work on the front end to make sure our budgets and time-frames are very accurate.<br>
