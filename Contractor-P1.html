Our business strategy is to purchase distressed residential properties, renovate it, and then sell it to retail homebuyers and landlords. We have an acquisition team constantly scanning the market for properties that meet our investment criteria. Our acquisitions specialists only get paid when we purchase a home, so they are highly motivated to find properties giving us a steady supply of projects for you and your team. We also work with a national group of investors who provide us with the funding we need to finance our aggressive approach to buying, renovating, and selling properties in compressed timeframes. This resource of fundsfunding resource allows us to buy properties quickly and consistently.<br><br>
<b>WE&rsquo;LL HELP YOU CREATE NEW BUSINESS</b><br>
We pride ourselves on having a strong foundation of real estate knowledge and training. Our core business lies within our systems, education, and knowledge of the real estate industry. We didn&rsquo;t just become a real estate investor overnight. We have spent thousands of dollars on education and systems that allow us to be successful in this business and do it the right way the first time. We actively share our knowledge with our contractors, providing them with the information they need to help develop their own businesses and create long-term success—for themselves and for their workers.

<b>WE&rsquo;LL MAKE YOUR LIFE EASIER</b><br>
We have a proven system in place with a pre-determined Scope Of Work containing all the details of the renovations in one spot, making life much easier for our contractors. We select all the materials that will go into our homes, and we clearly lay out everything that we want done by our contractors, so that they can focus on doing the work they do best—contracting. Working within our system will allow you to move from job to job to job, and not have to worry about where your next job is coming from. We always hear from our contractors that one of the best things about working with <b>S and S Property Group</b> is how every component in the Scope of Work is a line item wiht description details, and materials often even have the associated SKU# and where to purchase it included. We know time is money for both of us, so we do the extra work on the front end to make sure our budgets and time-frames are very accurate.<br>
