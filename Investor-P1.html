Our overall investment strategy and specialty is to purchase distressed properties at a deep discount – usually 30% to 50% below market value, and renovate and sell those properties to retail home buyers and landlords.
<br><br>
At <b>S and S Property Group</b>, we pride ourselves on having a strong foundation of real estate knowledge and training. Our focus is on providing SOLUTIONS for homeowners and finding VALUE for our buyers and investors by locating ugly, vacant homes that are eye sores and we put them back into use after renovation.<br>

<h3>Business Systems</h3>
Our core business lies within our systems, education and knowledge of the real estate industry. We did not just atend a webinar or buy a CD off the Internet to become a real estate investor overnight. We have spent thousands of dollars to learn how to be successful in this business and do it the right way the first time. Through our affiliation, we are connected with a national network of investors that provide continual support and weekly training on changes throughout our industry. This process has allowed us to circumvent many pitfalls most novice investors would make. Learning the hard way is not a phrase in our vocabulary, and we certainly would not ask anyone to invest with us if we weren’t confident enough to invest ourselves!<br>

We have a systematic and disciplined approach when purchasing investment properties, putting each potential investment through a strict due diligence process. This rigorous set of criteria includes, but is not limited to, the following:<ul>
<li>Comparable property analysis and examination by a certified, independent appraiser</li>
<li>An economic study of the neighborhood, city planning and development</li>
<li>Demographics of area, marketability, and growth potential</li>
<li>Statistics on the crime rate</li>
<li>Public transportation and schools</li>
<li>Overall condition of the property, including heating and air, plumbing, electrical, roof and structural condition</li></ul>
