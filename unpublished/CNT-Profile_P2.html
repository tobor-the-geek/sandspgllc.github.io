<b style="color:deepskyblue; font-size:110%;">The Glass is Half-Full</b><br>
We want contractors who have a positive, can-do attitude—sour grapes need not apply! We expect our contractors to be looking at the big picture and to understand the value of the long-term relationship and stability that we offer. As you know, unexpected circumstances happen on a job site. It’s imperative that you, your team, and S and S Property Group are all able to see beyond these bumps in the road, be resourceful, and come up with a timely and amicable solution for everyone involved. Focus on what can be done, not on what can’t!<br><br>
<b style="color:deepskyblue; font-size:110%;">We Always Pull Permits</b><br>
To ensure that our projects are done right and that buyers feel comfortable that the work was done correctly, we always pull permits. Permits protect both the contractor and us as the owner. If a contractor has a problem with that, then we won’t be working together.<br>
