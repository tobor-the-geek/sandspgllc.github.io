<h2 style="color:deepskyblue">Type of Contractor We Are Looking For</h2>
<div class="center";><span style="font-size:100%;">
An ideal contracting partnership consists of four main components: a consistent work ethic, superior workmanship, maintained job sites, and a passion to achieve a high-quality finished product.<br><br>
<b style="color:deepskyblue; font-size:110%;">The Ideal Fit For Us</b><br>
We’re looking for professional contractors who have high standards, with a team of reliable subcontractors who do quality work, and who have been in business for some time—with the track record and references to prove it. Here are some things we’re looking for in our contractors:<br>
<ul>
<li>Fully licensed with licenses up to date. Same with their subcontractors.</li>
<li>Insured—including workers comp, liability—with a minimum limit of $1 million.</li>
<li>Been in business in the area for at least three years.</li>
<li>Has a consistent crew of subcontractors.</li>
<li>Keeps worksite clean and maintained.</li>
<li>Can provide a list of references, with current contact information.</li>
<li>Belongs to the Better Business Bureau or one of the national associations of builders or carpenters.</li>
<li>Provides written warranties of a year or more for their work.</li>
<li>Is structured as a corporation or LLC.</li>
<li>A reputable company with no history of lawsuits.</li>
<li>Has financial resources—able to float material cost until work is complete and ready for draw.</li>
</ul>
<b style="color:deepskyblue; font-size:110%;">We Work on Volume</b><br>
Our strong financial backing allows us to aggressively pursue multiple homes every month through our acquisitions department. The fact that we work on this volume will keep you and your subcontractors busy throughout the year and ensure that you get paid quickly and consistently. There’s nothing worse than losing good subcontractors because you can’t keep them busy. When you find a quality employee, just like us you don’t want to lose them. Our steady-volume approach will save you from headaches and hours wrapped up in finding and having to train someone new.<br>
