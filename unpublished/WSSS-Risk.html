	<div class="center"; style="width:98%;">
	There’s no such thing as a perfect house -- every home, even newly constructed ones, will potentially have some issue or another. Our company builds value by rehabilitating properties in need of repairs - whether light cosmetic repairs, or significant repairs.<br><br>
 
	In many cases, we buy houses that have fire damage, termites, mold, foundation problems, roof problems or need other major repairs. Houses with these conditions scare most buyers, and most real estate agents don’t like listing them because they know such houses are hard to sell. We actually enjoy talking to sellers with these types of houses, because we can see the house’s potential value after all the repairs are made; and breathe new life back into them by renovating and improving the condition of the house.<br><br>
 
	Here are just a few risks involved when we purchase properties:<ul>
		<li>Previously unknown property conditions, or environmental hazards, such as toxic-mold, or others</li>
		<li>Expensive repair conditions may not have been apparent at, or became worse since the time of purchase</li>
		<li>Costly repairs not previously estimated for could offset the profit margin, such as HVAC, plumbing, foundation, etc.  </li>
		<li>Work permit complications, local restrictions, or codes and other legal problems that can arise</li>
		<li>Unexpectedly longer times in holding a property for repair, or marketing time extended, causing profits to be exhausted</li>
		<li>Ever changing market conditions, including lending requirements and availability of applicable mortgages for buyers</li>
	</ul>

		We Buy Homes In Any Condition! </div> <! end of emp>
		<p>Inspections on a home are helpful; however, the reality is - we never know what we're getting into until we start the renovation process.<br><br>
		Sometimes what seems like the simplest fix turns into a massive remodel - resulting in spending thousands of unexpected dollars.  This is the risk we take when buying homes AS IS.<br><br>
		We do all the heavy lifting on the backend, so you don't have to before you sell.</p>
