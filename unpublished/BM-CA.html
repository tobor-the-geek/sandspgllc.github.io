Most homeowners have no idea what options are available to them beyond listing a house with a real estate agent or just trying to sell the house on their own, and hope for the best. We provide homeowners with a unique alternative to listing their house on their own or with a real estate agent. Our “out of the box” creative approach to real estate investing is a cut above the rest.<br><br>
Our company can acquire great deals on properties because we have the ability to act quickly and can close with CASH on the seller’s timeline. This is why we can buy properties at such a discount, sometimes in a matter of days. We have a competitive advantage over other investors who sometimes take weeks to purchase properties, and can create extremely fast and hassle-free transactions. <br><br>
We have an aggressive TEAM approach, and a top-notch ability to expand our client base through our knowledge of deal structuring and advanced real estate techniques.<br>
We also employ marketing strategies as soon as we purchase a <img style="float:left; display:block; margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto; border: 2px solid silver; padding 2px; width: 15%; max-width:360px;" alt="Bag of Money" src="../images/Bag-of-Money-Small.png" />home – giving us a fair advantage over a real estate agent. Typically, many agents don’t spend time or money on marketing or lead generation strategies. As a result, it can sometimes take months to attract potential buyers. Often times, we are able to find our own buyers, allowing us to secure a strong sales price and save on sales commissions.<br><br>
Our renovation process is also down to a science with handpicked and proven construction crews who know we are not retail clients. We pay wholesale prices to all contractors and typically get bulk discounts on all materials. <br><br>
