<b style="color:deepskyblue; font-size:1.1em;">Become part of our TEAM!</b><br>
In working with us, there are several benefits and different ways you can generate revenue:<br>
	<ul class="c"; style="font-size:1em">
	<li><b>Represent Us As Our Buyer's Agent</b><br>
		&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We Are CASH Investors & Buy 8-12 Properties A Year</li>
	<li><b>Represent Us As Our Listing Agent</b><br>
		&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Re-List Our Fully Renovated Vacant Properties In Your Area</li>
	<li><b>Be Our Referral Agent</b><br>
		&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Tap Into Our List of Buyer, Seller & Short Sale Leads</li>
	<li><b>Generate Buyers Via Open Houses</b><br>
		&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Market our “Pocket” Listings</li>
	</ul>
Although many of our offers will be typically lower than retail clients, we serve as a great benefit for  hard-to-sell properties or those requiring the bank or seller to move quickly. We are also a good fit if you  have listings that have difficulty qualifying for traditional financing based on the current condition of the  property. We are not the perfect fit for everyone; but for the seller with the right motivation, these  features are a necessity.<br><br>

	As an agent working with an investor, you can increase your profit; but not necessarily increase the amount  of work you need to do to close each deal. Your goal should be to:
	<ul>
	<li>Spend no more than a few hours per day finding and making offers on our behalf</li>
	<li>Automate most of the work –utilizing our documents such as repair sheets and deal analyzer</li>
	<li>Specialize in a very specific, relatively small, geographic area – therefore, not spending your time  driving all over looking at houses</li>
