<b style="color:darkslateblue; font-size:1.1em;">Cash</b><br>
Cash held in most types of bank accounts can be accessed quickly and can fund your deals in minutes, instead of hours or days. Fees are generally minimal for wire transfers and cashier’s checks.<br><br>
<b style="color:darkslateblue; font-size:1.1em;">Home Equity Line of Credit</b><br>
A home equity line of credit is a very powerful source of funding that many people have and don’t even think of. Unleveraged equity is dead money and it’s not making any interest. You can easily tap into that money. It’s a way to make sure you’re in first position when we’re ready to pull the trigger and buy a property. <br><br>
<b style="color:darkslateblue; font-size:1.1em;">Personal & Business Lines of Credit</b><br>
Personal loans and “signature lines of credit” can be obtained from most banks or credit unions by anyone with good credit and a stable income.<br><br>
<b style="color:darkslateblue; font-size:1.1em;">Retirement Accounts</b><br>
More and more private money lenders are using their IRA funds to invest in real estate. A self-directed IRA is essentially the same as a traditional IRA, but allows you to purchase a broader range of investments, including real estate.<br><br>
<b style="color:darkslateblue; font-size:1.1em;">Liquidated Securities & Investments</b><br>
Investments are a way to put your savings to work earning more money. However, if your stocks and investments have not performed as you had expected, it might be time to consider other investments. As you know, stocks can be liquidated as and when you wish. Sometimes you need to liquidate your investments because you need the money for something you want to purchase such as real estate.<br>
