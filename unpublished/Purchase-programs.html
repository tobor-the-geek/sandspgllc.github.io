<b class="emh";>HOME BUYER EDUCATION</b><br>
The home buying process can seem complicated, but if you take things step-by-step, you will soon be holding the keys to your own home!  First, you need to know how and where to begin. We will answer all of the questions you have when deciding whether or not you are ready to buy a home.  With all of the details involved, we will be there to hold your hand and navigate you through every step.<br><br>
<b class="emh";>KNOWING AND UNDERSTANDING YOUR CREDIT</b><br>
It’s important to understand the importance of credit and how it affects you when buying a home.  Together, we can find out what your credit score is and discuss what it says to lenders.  We can show you how to get a free copy of your credit report and how to correct any errors you may find.  If you have not-so-great credit, we also work with credit repair experts who can help you repair your damaged credit and put you back on the right path.  We also have an excellent rent-to-own program that is beneficial to you during the transition if needed.<br><br>
<b class="emh";>RENT-TO-OWN PROGRAM</b><br>
If you aren’t quite ready to purchase yet, you can really benefit from our rent-to-own program. The program was designed to help renters with credit issues who can’t yet qualify for a mortgage or don't have a large lump sum of cash available for a down payment. With our rent-to-own program, instead of just paying rent, your rent payments apply toward the purchase of a home!  So you can build equity, while repairing your damaged credit to qualify for a mortgage.<br><br>
