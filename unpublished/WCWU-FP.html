<h2 style="color:deepskyblue">Why Contracors Love Working With Us</h2>
<div class="center";><span style="font-size:110%;">
We work hard to create positive and productive mutually beneficial relationships with our affiliated businesses and contracting teams. We strive to assist in the business development of our contracting teams with a goal of mutual growth and continued, long-term success. The use of our proven construction rehab system results in a more predictable and efficient process which consistently creates a superior product and increased profit for our contractors. <br><br>
Here are just a few of the benefits of working with S and S Property Group:<br><br>
<b style="color:deepskyblue; font-size:120%;">We Love to Pay Our Contractors</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let’s get this straight right up front: Unlike some companies you may have worked with in the past, we love to pay our contractors. Really! We know you’ve got a business to run and bills to pay—so do we. We understand that when you complete a payment milestone that you want to get your payment as soon as possible. And we know that it’s in our interest to have a committed, happy contractor as a partner. So we will pay you—and pay you promptly—as the work is completed in the stages laid out at the onset of the project.<br><br>

<b style="color:deepskyblue; font-size:120%;">A Steady Stream of Work</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our business strategy is to purchase distressed residential properties, and then renovate and sell them to retail homebuyers and landlords. We have a dedicated acquisition team constantly scanning the market for properties that meet our investment profile. Our acquisitions specialists only get paid when we purchase a home, so they are highly motivated to find properties giving us a steady supply of projects for you and your team. We also work with a national group of investors who provide us with the funding we need to finance our aggressive approach to buying, rehabbing, and selling properties in short timeframes. This resource of funds allows us to buy properties quickly and consistently.<br>
