Most people think that an IRA can only be used to purchase investments, like stocks and mutual funds. But that’s not true! You can get private mortgage loans using the funds which are already in your IRA’S and other retirement plans. <br><br>
As it pertains to lending for real estate investments, enter the Self-Directed IRA. The IRS has set forth guidelines on what you can and cannot invest in with your IRA. Many people are surprised at the scope of options available. From tax liens, gold, real estate investments and real estate notes, IRA’s are much more powerful than most people ever realized. If you add to that power of a Roth IRA which allows you to enjoy your earnings tax-free or deferred, and you’ve got a fast road to an easy retirement!<br><br>
However, in order for you to use retirement accounts for loans, they must first be administered by a third party custodian. After selecting your custodian, you simply send a transfer form to them and they’ll do all the work for you, once you've done that you are ready to make private mortgage loans. We would be happy to recommend a local custodian we’ve worked with in the past who can assist you with setting up your account.<br><br>
