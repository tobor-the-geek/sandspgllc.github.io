<div class="center";><span>
As well-established real estate professionals, we are in this business for the long haul. We place a high priority on developing long-term relationships with our customers and our contractors so that we all achieve our goals.<br>
<p><b style="color:deepskyblue; font-size:1.1em;">Short Term Goals </b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Here are a few benefits your sellers have when working with S and S Property Group to sell their home:Our short term goal is to aggressively expand the presence of our business in surrounding markets. Each year for the past 10 years the group we are associated with has surpassed our residential redevelopment goals. Our current annual projection is to renovate three or more homes and acquire a new rental property. The rehab budgets on our projects generally range from $5,000 on a rental property to $250,000 on a full rehab. Typical project time frames generally run from 3-6 months. Our goal is to turn around our projects at a rapid pace so we can get paid as quickly as possible and use those profits to immediately start on the next rehab. This ensures that we and our contractor teams have a steady supply of work.</p>

	<li>Purchase small tracts of land and develop residential communities throughout the greater Franklin County  area. To accomplish this long-term goal, it will be imperative that we develop strong relationships with contractors who have a like-minded goal of expansion.</li>
