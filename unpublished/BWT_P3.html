<h2 style="color:deepskyblue">Benefits of Working Together</h2>
<div class="center";><span style="font-size:100%;">
<b style="color:deepskyblue">Access to property inventory before listed</b><br>
A successful and active investor will constantly have an inventory of completely renovated properties; and YOU will have access to that inventory BEFORE that property is listed on the MLS. This creates  a great opportunity for buyers – especially a first-time homebuyer, as they would have the chance to purchase a newly renovated and fairly priced property. In some cases, your buyers can also have the benefit of giving input on certain features of their home and choosing custom finishes BEFORE renovations are fully complete. By providing this option to your buyer, it completely differentiates you from other agents – therefore, directly impacting your bottom-line!<br><br>
<b style="color:deepskyblue">Opportunity to host Open Houses</b><br>
Newly renovated vacant properties generate a lot of interest from potential buyers, like a neighbor or anyone else looking for properties priced aggressively and in pristine condition. 
<div class="pictl";><img style="width: 100%;  border: 2px solid silver;" alt="&nbsp;Buyer" src="../images/Happy-buyer.png"/></div> <! end of nested pictr>By acting as a seller’s agent, this creates a great opportunity to host open houses for these properties; allowing you to meet many new potential buyers that you can add to your database, and possibly cultivate as buyer clients of your own.<br><br>
<b style="color:deepskyblue;">Short sale referrals</b><br>
Successful investors are excellent marketers and generate a lot of leads, many of which are short sales. In most cases, investors aren’t too interested in working with sellers whose properties are over-  leveraged and in short sale situations. The short sale process can be lengthy, so many investors prefer to refer those leads to a specialist rather than work with the sellers themselves. This creates a huge  opportunity for you to become a “short sale specialist”, by listing these properties and getting the commission when they sell. As a short sale specialist, you also have the opportunity of working with multiple investors, which provides you with more of an revenue stream ten fold!<br>
