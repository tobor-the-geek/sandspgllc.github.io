<h3>Pre-Approval & Mortgage Preparation</h3>
Applying for a loan and obtaining approval before you find a home you want to purchase can be a distinct advantage and is necessary, unless you are going to purchase the home with cash. We will need to have a pre-approval letter from your bank, credit union, or mortgage broker which states the amount they are willing to lend you for a home mortgage.<br><br>
If you don't know where to begin in getting a loan, we can assist you with selecting the right mortgage professional and refer you to local bankers and mortgage brokers that have served our clients
<div class="small3"; style="border: 2px solid darkslateblue;"><span><div class="poi" style="border: 2px solid darkslateblue;">Advantages of being Pre-Approved:<br>
   <ul>
      <li>Minimize the anxiety of not know rather or not you are qualify.</li>
      <li>Avoid the disappoitment of deciding on a home, that you cannot affoard</li>
      <li>Save money with a Seller who is confident to taking their home off-market with a buyers who have a definite loan commitment</li>
      <li>One less contingency the seller to be concerned with to get hheir home sold</li>
      <li>Faster process to close (Mortgage approval is often the lengthiest contingency) - also the appraisal can be done quickly</li>
   </ul><br>

 well in the past. We encourage all of our clients to give our preferred lenders a call - there is no obligation and you may just save some money. (We do not receive any benefit from any company to which we refer our clients. Our referrals are based on past experience with those companies, and our criteria are simple. They have to treat our clients with the same level of care and service that we provide, they have to maintain good communication, and they can't make mistakes!)<br><br>
<h3>Pre-Qualification vs. Pre-Approval</h3>
<ul>
   <li>A pre-qualification is simply the bank's best guess as to how much you would qualify to buy based on general information you provide about your employment and finances. In this process, any obvious difficulties that might cause problems might be discovered.</li>
   <li>A pre-approval requires a complete application after the bank actually verifies your employment, checks your credit history, etc.  A pre-approval letter is a commitment by the bank to actually loan you a specific amount of money at a specific interest rate. The main benefit in getting pre-qualified is that it is an expression of your seriousness in purchasing a home, which may be a deciding factor in a situation of competing offers from other not-yet qualified buyers on your dream home.</li>
</ul>
