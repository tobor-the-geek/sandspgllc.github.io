	</div> <! end of pictr > within our systems, education, and knowledge of the real estate industry. We didn’t just become a real estate investor overnight. We have spent thousands of dollars on education and systems that allow us to be successful in this business and do it the right way the first time. We actively share our knowledge with our contractors, providing them with the information they need to help develop their own businesses and create long-term success—for themselves and for their workers. Renovating several homes a year generates tons of old and new clients asking for renovation advice, and more important, a “Good Contractor.” We believe wholeheartedly in recommending the people who help support our growth and would gladly recommend you and your team.<br><br>
<b style="color:deepskyblue; font-size:110%;">We'll make your life easier</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have a proven system in place with a pre-determined Scope Of Work containing all the details of the renovations in one spot, making life much easier for our contractors. We select all the materials that will go into our homes, and we clearly lay out everything that we want done by our contractors, so that they can focus on doing the work they do best—contracting. Working within our system will allow you to move from job to job to job, and not have to worry about where your next job is coming from. We always hear from our contractors that one of the best things about working with S and S Property Group is how every component in the Scope of Work is line-itemed, and materials often even have the associated SKU# and where to purchase it included. We know time is money for both of us, so we do the extra work on the front end to make sure our budgets and timeframes are very accurate.<br>
