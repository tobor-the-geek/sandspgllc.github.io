<h2 style="color:deepskyblue;">Short &amp; Long Term Renovation Goals</b></h2>
<div class="center";><span>
To generate value, we focus on aggressive project management coupled with the use of highly skilled and professional independent contractors to complete our renovations. In addition, we employ proactive marketing tactics to pre-sell our properties during the rehab stage instead of waiting until the project is complete. This gives us a head start that often enables us to sell our properties before the paint has even dried on them. Successful execution of these strategies rely on the high quality of work performed by our contractors, which is why we put such a high premium on finding the best contractors in the area and then developing long-term, mutually beneficial win-win relationships. <br>
