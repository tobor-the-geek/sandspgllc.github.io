<b style="color:deepskyblue; font-size:110%;">What is Private Lending?</b><br>
A private money loan is a loan that is given to a real estate investor, secured by real estate. Private money lenders are given a first or second mortgage that secures their legal interest in the property and secures their funds. When we have located a home that is well under market value, we give our private lenders an opportunity to fund the purchase and rehab of the home. Through that process, the lender can yield extremely high interest rates – 4 or 5 times the rates you can get on bank CD’s and other traditional investment plans.<br><br>
Essentially, private money lending is your opportunity to become the bank, reaping the profits just like a bank would. It’s a great way to generate cash flow and produce a predictable income stream - while at the same time, provide excellent security and safety for your principal funds. You can do what the banks have been doing for years…make a profitable return on investments backed by real estate. There is no other investment vehicle like it.<br><br>

<b style="color:deepskyblue; font-size:110%;">How The Process Works</b><br>The process is simple. We find an extremely undervalued property we want to purchase - and once you give us the green light, we borrow the funds from you to purchase and renovate the property. At closing, you receive a mortgage on the home along with other important documents. Next stage is the property renovation. Once the renovations are complete (typically 3-6 months depending on the size of the project), we’ll list and sell the property. When it’s time for closing, you’ll receive your principal plus 10% interest payment. It’s just that simple! The goal is to keep turning that money for you and keep you making substantial profits so you keep coming back to us – building a long term mutually beneficial relationship.<br><br>
