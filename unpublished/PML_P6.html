<b style="color:deepskyblue; font-size:1.2em;">How Private Money Helps Our Company</b><br>
Private money lenders bring speed and efficiency to our transactions, and our leverage is far greater when we purchase using private cash funds. Many of the homes we are purchasing are in need of quick sale within 10-14 days. A traditional bank requires 30-45 days to close a loan. Many traditional home sales fall out of contract because of financing issues.  Using quick cash as leverage allows us to negotiate a much lower purchase price and reduce our risk.<br><br>
	<div class="paperc"; style="font-size:1em;"><b style="font-size:1.2em%;">Our Benefits of Using Private Money</b><ul>
	<li>We wonâ€™t have to deal with banks, applications, approvals, etc.</li>
	<li>We can buy at deeper discounts</li>
	<li>Gives us a competitive advantage above the rest</li>
	<li>Allows us to buy with cash - Cash is King</li>
	</ul></div> <! end of paperc > <br><br>
Being able to offer a fast closing with private funds motivates sellers to take our offer over the competition, and entices them to take a much lower price than they would from a conventional buyer. Also, lending guidelines are also continually changing and are requiring applications, approvals, junk fees and strict investor guidelines. They also limit the number of investment properties that can be purchased by one company.<br><br><br>
On a new home purchase requiring renovations, private lender funds will be allocated to the purchase price, renovations, carrying costs, cost to resell and a small buffer for unexpected expenses.<br><br>
