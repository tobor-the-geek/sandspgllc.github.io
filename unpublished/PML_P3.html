You, as the private money lender can benefit greatly from investing your capital. A real estate mortgage/ deed of trust provides you with security instruments you would not get with other 
investments.

There are added layers of protection because of how we buy. This is a recourse loan, you can collect on the asset, in case we were to default on the loan. We currently pay 4-5 times what a typical bank CD is paying. Our rates will fluctuate very little all depending on the purchase price and rehab involved. The lower the price we pay for a home, the more we can return as a slightly higher rate to make sure our lenders see it as worth their time. Private lending means you can relax while the money is in a truly safe place, working for you.<br><br>
