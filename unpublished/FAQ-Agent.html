<hr>
<div class="center";><span style="font-size:110%;">
<b style="color:deepskyblue">WILL I BE REQUIRED TO SPEND A LOT OF TIME DRIVING AROUND SHOWING  YOU PROPERTIES TO BUY?</b><br>
No, not at all! We already know what we’re looking for, and our criteria typically stay the same. While  we may need you to let us inside a property once in a while, we wouldn’t ask you to spend your time on  wild goose chases.<br><br>
<b style="color:deepskyblue">IS IT WORTH MY TIME TO WORK WITH AN INVESTOR?</b><br>
Yes! You can automate most of the process so you’re not wasting your time on working on tedious  tasks. By working with an investor, you create a very lucrative source of income as well. In a partnership  with us, you can earn multiple commissions by representing us as both the buyers and sellers agents.<br><br>
<b style="color:deepskyblue">WHAT KINDS OF OFFERS DO INVESTORS USUALLY MAKE?</b><br>
Our offers are in cash. They are below retail, but they are also highly valuable because they are cash  offers. Some of our offers do get rejected; but, unlike traditional clients who may buy or sell a home  once every five years, we make multiple transactions annually.<br><br>
<b style="color:deepskyblue">HOW CAN I WORK WITH S AND S PROPERTY GROUP?</b><br>
You have the opportunity to become what we call a “triple agent.” When working with S and S Property Group, you can act as the buyers agent, the listing agent and the referral agent. In other words,  you may be able to earn triple commission on a single deal. Secondly, we will actively send you leads on listings and give you the right to generate more leads by marketing our homes once the renovations are  complete. We can also will send buyers to you.<br><br>
<b style="color:deepskyblue">WHAT TYPES OF PROPERTIES DO YOU PURCHASE FROM SELLERS?</b><br>
We purchase homes in pre-foreclosure, over-leveraged, condemned, liens or health department  violations, not maintained, fire damaged, estate sales, stagnant listings, even about to fall down homes
- we can buy it!
