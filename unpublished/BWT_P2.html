<h2 style="color:deepskyblue">Benefits of Working Together</h2>
<div class="center";><span style="font-size:100%;">
<b style="color:deepskyblue">Gain Repeat Business</b><br>
One of the main benefits of working with an investor is the potential for repeat business throughout the  course of a year. By working consistently with a successful investor who actively buys and sells  properties, you can predict a steady revenue stream based on their level of activity. Although it varies,  most real estate agents typically close between 2 to 10 deals per year with investors. A good agent will  be able to leverage those deals into even more deals, just by working with the buyers who purchase investment properties.<br><br>
<b style="color:deepskyblue">Opportunity to make both sides of commission</b><br>
By acting as a dual agent in a transaction, representing both the buyer and seller, you can earn both  sides of the commission. For example, let’s say that you as a licensed agent have an REO property  listed. Our goal is for the agents we work with to be excited to work with us which is why we’re happy  for you if you received both sides of the commission. That merely means you were great at your job!<br><br>

	<b style="color:deepskyblue;">Become a distressed property specialist</b><br>
	There are a number of properties in the marketplace needing renovations – anything from cosmetic  repairs to full-gut rehabs. Often times, you as the agent are the first contact for sellers behind on payments, who need to sell quickly, or don’t have equity in their home. These are exactly the types of opportunities we are looking for. If you or someone in your office have these types of listings, we may be able to quickly purchase the homes with CASH. After a few successful transactions you can utilize that success to gain more exposure in your market and build your credibility as a distressed property specialist – ultimately, increasing your income opportunity.
