Most homeowners have no idea what options are available to them beyond listing a house with a Realtor or trying to sell the house on their own and just hoping for the best. We provide a unique alternative to listing their house on their own or with a Realtor. Your Realtor gets paid a commission for thier services which is a percentage of the home&rsquo;s selling price. In most cases, you may also be encouraged to fix up your home and yard to attract more potential buyers – and sometimes it can involve hiring expensive contractors.<br>
