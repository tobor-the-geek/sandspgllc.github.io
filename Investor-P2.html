Most homeowners have no idea what options are available to them beyond listing a house with a real estate agent or just trying to sell the house on their own, and hope for the best. We provide homeowners with a unique alternative to listing their house on their own or with a real estate agent. Our “out of the box” creative approach to real estate investing is a cut above the rest.<br>

<h3> Power of a Cash offer</h3>
Our company can acquire great deals on properties because we have the ability to act quickly and can close with CASH on the seller’s timeline. This is why we can buy properties at such a discount, sometimes in a matter of days. We have a competitive advantage over other investors who sometimes take weeks to purchase properties, and can create extremely fast and hassle-free transactions. We have an aggressive TEAM approach, and a top-notch ability to expand our client base through our knowledge of deal structuring and advanced real estate techniques.<br>

<h3> Marketing Strategy</h3>
We also employ marketing strategies as soon as we purchase a home – giving us a fair advantage over a real estate agent. Typically, many agents don’t spend time or money on marketing or lead generation strategies. As a result, it can sometimes take months to attract potential buyers. Often times, we are able to find our own buyers, allowing us to secure a strong sales price and save on sales commissions. <br>

Our renovation process is also down to a science with hand picked and proven construction crews who know we are not retail clients. We pay wholesale prices to all contractors and typically get bulk discounts on all materials.<br>

<h3>Investing Benefits</h3>
Investing with us also provides a win-win for the homeowner as well. With your funding, we can offer homeowners something that very few buyers can. We are helping sellers by purchasing their homes in their timeline -- in as little as 10 days. Knowing that we are going to renovate the home and are buying in as-is condition is a very important factor to sellers who live in older, dated homes, or those desprately needing repairs. These sellers will also not be required to pay any attorney fees, closing costs, home warranties, inspection fees, realtor commissions, etc. We are not the perfect fit for everyone; but for the seller with the right motivation, these features are a necessity.<br>
