<h3 style="font-size: 5vw;">First-time Homebuyers</h3>
<BR>
<div class="left9"><p><span>Buying a home can be exciting, stressful and puzzling, all at once. After all, you are making what’s likely to be the largest purchase of your lifetime. Your home is not only a financial asset; it’s a place for you to build your life and your family. We have helped numerous families achieve the dream of home ownership through our first time homebuyer educational program and credit repair program. <br><br>
If you are a first-time homebuyer who has been looking for the perfect opportunity to buy a new home, then the time is now. 
<div class="boi"; style="float:right;"><div class="pictr";><img style="border: 1px solid Silver; width: 100%; alt="&nbsp;First-time_homebuyer" src="images/First-time-homebuyer.png" /></div> <! end of prictr> </div> <! end of boi>
The current real estate market is perfect for everything from buying a new home to investing in the real estate market, which is why first-time home buyers and investors have been going head to head and competing for the best real estate on the market.<br><br>Why, exactly is now a great time for first time homebuyers to purchase a new home? At S and S Property Group, we know there are opportunities in ANY real estate market. With our buying strategies, we’re able to find great values - whether in a down market or in a booming real estate market.<br><br>
Our goal is to help make your home buying and selling processes flow smoothly and trouble free.  By providing you with quality information, you'll thoroughly understand the process and details of buying a home. You’ll make the best decisions when you’re most informed.<br><br>
</span></p></div>

<h3 style="font-size: 5vw;">Landlords</h3>
<div class="left9"><p><span>Whether you are an experienced investor with a large portfolio or just starting out and looking to purchase your first rental property, 
<div class="boi"; style="float:left;"><div class="pictl";><img style="border: 1px solid Silver; width: 100%;" alt="&nbsp;House Row" src="images/House-row.png" /> </div> <! end of pictl> </div> <! end of boi><b>S and S Property Group</b> can help you accomplish your goals. It is not uncommon for us to find properties at 60 to 70% of market value. We offer some of these directly to landlords to renovate as they like, others we complete the renovation and offer more of a turnkey opportunity. Still often below retail value. <br><br>
Historically, real estate has been a solid long-term investment. Although the real estate market goes through cycles of ups and downs, it generally increases in value over time. Like any other buyer, money is made when you buy the property, not when you sell. We work with residential investors to help ensure that you are buying at the best possible price and terms in keeping with your investment goals.<br><br>
</span></p></div>
<h3 style="font-size: 5vw;">Rehabbers</h3>
<div class="left9";><p><span><div class="boi2"; style="float:right;"><div class="pictr";><img style="border: 1px solid Silver; width: 100%;" alt="&nbsp;Contractor" src="images/Csmall-1.png" /> </div> <! end of prictr> </div> <! end of boi>At <b>S and S Property Group</b>, we have created a marketing machine 
that produces a TON of leads. Many of these leads we receive have untapped equity that as a rehabber, you can capitalize on. We actually produce so many leads, that our company can’t possibly renovate them all. 
When we are booked up with a lot of projects, we will actually pass along our wholesale deals to investors like you.<br><br>
 We have a ton of experience in buying, fixing and reselling single family homes throughout Franklin County and surrounding areas. This means we will share all of our contacts from our hard money lenders, to our insurance providers, as well as our contractors! Yes, we will actually give you the opportunity to use our prescreened contractors we use on our own rehabs. Whether your goal is long-term cash flow and retirement equity, or a property to fix and flip, we will help match you to the right property.<br><br>
