<h3>Landlords</h3>
<div class="left9"; style="min-height:20vw;"><p><span>Whether you are an experienced investor with a large portfolio or just starting out and looking to purchase your first rental property, 
<div class="boi"; style="float:left;"><img style="border: 1px solid Silver; width: 100%;" alt="&nbsp;House Row" src="images/House-row.png" /> </div> <! end of boi><b>S and S Property Group</b> can help you accomplish your goals. It is not uncommon for us to find properties at 60 to 70% of market value. We offer some of these directly to landlords to renovate as they like, others we complete the renovation and offer more of a turnkey opportunity. Still often below retail value. <br><br>
Historically, real estate has been a solid long-term investment. Although the real estate market goes through cycles of ups and downs, it generally increases in value over time. Like any other buyer, money is made when you buy the property, not when you sell. We work with residential investors to help ensure that you are buying at the best possible price and terms in keeping with your investment goals.<br>

<h3>Rehabbers</h3>
<div class="left9"; style="min-height:20vw;"><p><span style:"object-fill: contain;"><div class="boi2"; style="float:right;"><img style="border: 1px solid Silver; width: 100%;" alt="&nbsp;Contractor" src="images/Csmall-1.png" /> </div>At <b>S and S Property Group</b>, we have created a marketing machine that produces a TON of leads. Many of these leads we receive have untapped equity that as a rehabber, you can capitalize on. We actually produce so many leads, that our company can’t possibly renovate them all. 
When we are booked up with a lot of projects, we will actually pass along our wholesale deals to investors like you.<br><br>
 We have a ton of experience in buying, fixing and reselling single family homes throughout Franklin County and surrounding areas. This means we will share all of our contacts from our hard money lenders, to our insurance providers, as well as our contractors! Yes, we will actually give you the opportunity to use our prescreened contractors we use on our own rehabs. Whether your goal is long-term cash flow and retirement equity, or a property to fix and flip, we will help match you to the right property.<br>
