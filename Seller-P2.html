Utilizing cash funding from our nation wide network of investors allows us to circumvent many of the nuances of a traditional real estate closing. We can purchase your home directly from you, and you won&rsquo;t have to pay Realtor commissions. In addition to our funding source, we will be buying the home absolutely AS IS – meaning, we would never ask you to make a single repair on the home. Furthermore, <b>S and S Property Group</b> fully understands the importance of timing. You may be in a situation where you need to close quickly or, you may need time to transition your life. Either way, we can facilitate easy closing on your time-line, from as quick as 10 days or less to as long as you need. We are here to work with you<br>

<div class="emp"; style="color:Blue;"><b>Loan Modification Programs</b></div><! end of emp><br>
A <q>Loan Modification Program</q> is a special program designed to help homeowners who have experienced a previous hardship, get back on track with their mortgage. We will work directly with you and your lender to help you qualify. However, you must have recovered from that hardship, and be able to make your mortgage payments again. Often times, the lender will require some sort of partial payment before they will consider a loan modification program. The relationships we have with many banks will help you immensely during this process.<br>

With today&rsquo;s transitioning real estate market, it can be very difficult for some homeowners to sell their property. You may be overleveraged and tempted to just walk away from the home. However, this is not in your best interest, and there are serious consequences if you let the home go into foreclosure. If you are currently experiencing this scenario, it is important to know that you do have options! We are very successful at negotiating debt with banks, and can often times purchase the property directly from you - thus saving you from a foreclosure.<br>

Our primary focus is in revitalizing neighborhoods. If your home is located in an area where we are not working, or your property does not fit our criteria, we are happy to refer you to a Realtor for your area. We know that not all Realtors are created equal. Therefore, we provide referrals to Realators that have goals in alignment with our company.<br>

Occasionally, we sell houses that have not completed renovation. When selling these properties in need of repair, it’s very important for the buyer to have specialized knowledge to identify any possible renovation costs associated with improving the property. When working with our company, you can be rest assured that we&rsquo;re very qualified and experienced in accurately estimating repairs and consulting with buyers on the renovation process.<br>
